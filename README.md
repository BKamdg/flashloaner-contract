I'm just playing around in DeFi.  My wife hates that I keep spending/losing money here.
I have no history in coding, I don't know the language or how it works.  But I'm here learning.  
What's my goal?
I hope to make some money to be able to buy a house and retire.  Who knows what's gonna happen.  
Happy hunting
